 STEP 1: Fire It Up

Make sure you’ve got Python 3 installed.
Check with:

python --version


Then run the demo:

python event_router_cli.py



You’ll see a little intro message pop up in the terminal.

 STEP 2: Talk To It Like 

Type whatever feels natural. It doesn’t need to be perfect. Examples:

shOw mE f0otbal1l games on thursday
i wanna see sports
info session and resume on weds
events at clarice on fri


You can use slang, typos, abbreviations  it’ll try to figure it out.
Type exit or quit when you’re done.

STEP 3: What You’ll See

The program breaks your sentence down and prints:

Normalized text: cleaned up version of what you said

Spell-fixed: what it thinks you meant

Category: like “sports”, “careers”, “academics”, or “arts & culture”

Day filter: if you said something like “Thursday” or “Fri”

Entities: the keywords it pulled (like “football”, “resume”)

Then it’ll show matching mock events, like:

- Maryland Football vs. Example U | Thursday 7:00 PM | SECU Stadium | tags: football


If nothing matches, it’ll say “No matching events found.”

STEP 4: Try To Break It (Kinda)

The point is to see how smart it is, so go wild:

Misspell stuff: f0otbal1l, basktball

Use abbreviations: weds, thur, fri

Be lazy: show me sports

Mix stuff: resume or interview events on tues

See how well it figures you out.

 STEP 5: Give Feedback

After testing, let me know:

Did it understand you?

Did it find the right events?

Did it correct your typos properly?

Anything that felt off or confusing?

 Quick Summary

You type:

shOw mE f0otbal1l games on thursday

It understands:
→ sports, football, thursday

It shows:

football games happening Thursday
